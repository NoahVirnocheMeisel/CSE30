# file: hangman.py is a program that runs the classic word game Hangman. The object is to guess a word by guessing
# letters in a limited number of attempts.
# input: The user inputs the size of the dictionary word, and the number of attempts they will have to guess the word
# output: After each guess from the user, the program will tell the user if the letter guessed is in the word
# and update the shown parts of the word accordingly. It will also add the letter to the list of already guessed
# letters for the user to see. Once the user guesses the word, or runs out of lives, the program will output an
# appropriate message and then ask the user if they want to play again.

dictionary_file = "dictionary.txt"   # make a dictionary.txt in the same folder where hangman.py is located
# write all your functions here

# make a dictionary from a dictionary file ('dictionary.txt', see above)
# dictionary keys are word sizes (1, 2, 3, 4, â€¦, 12), and values are lists of words
# for example, dictionary = { 2 : ['Ms', 'ad'], 3 : ['cat', 'dog', 'sun'] }
# if a word has the size more than 12 letters, put it into the list with the key equal to 12
